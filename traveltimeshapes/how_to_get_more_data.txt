This is a clunky way to get data, but saves you from having to pay for an API that you will use maybe once a year.

Goto this website:
https://playground.traveltime.com/isochrones

Update the inputs to give you the shape you want. On the right there will be two boxes you can copy. The top one is request, that goes into a 'name_request.txt' file. The bottom one is geojson data for the shape, that goes into a 'name_polygon.txt' file. The script 'redfin_build_travel_shapes.py' combines the two and then writes a combined geopandas dataframe in pickle format to disk.

It does not check for duplicated, you're going to need to be careful to not add the same thing a billion times.
